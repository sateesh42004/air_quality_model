# Air Quality Prediction (PM2.5)

This project predicts **PM2.5 concentrations** using meteorological and air quality data with a **Linear Regression model**.  
The goal is to understand how factors like **PM10, air temperature, and time features** influence PM2.5 pollution levels.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Features

- **year** â€“ Year of measurement  
- **month** â€“ Month of measurement  
- **day** â€“ Day of measurement  
- **hour** â€“ Hour of measurement  
- **PM10** â€“ Particulate Matter â‰¤ 10 Âµm  
- **AT** â€“ Air Temperature  

Target variable:  
- **PM2.5** â€“ Particulate Matter â‰¤ 2.5 Âµm

##  Model Details

- **Algorithm:** Linear Regression  
- **Data Split:** 80% training / 20% testing  
- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
  - RÂ² Score  

---

## Results

- Scatter plot of **Actual vs Predicted PM2.5** values is generated.  
- Predictions generally follow the trend of actual values.  
- The model performs well for **low PM2.5 values**, but **underestimates at higher values**.  

---

## Future Improvements

- Try advanced models: **Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost**  
- Add **feature scaling** for better regression performance  
- Explore **time-series forecasting** methods  
- Perform **feature engineering** (humidity, wind speed, seasonal effects, etc.)

## Example Output

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** *(varies with dataset)*  
- **RÂ² Score:** *(shows model accuracy)*
