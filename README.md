# air_quality_model
This project predicts PM2.5 air pollution levels using machine learning. It uses historical air quality and weather data (PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, RH, WS, etc.) with Linear Regression to estimate PM2.5. Includes preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of actual vs predicted results.
